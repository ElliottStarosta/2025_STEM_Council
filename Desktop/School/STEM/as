I am using node.js so iyou can sue third party libarie such as GSAP to do animations.
3) The website has the following sections, Home
About Us
Clubs
Events
Resources

Your job is to make the hero page where it will display mayve a button for events. Just make it interactive, but not laggy. 
4) ONLY DO THINGS YOU CAN DO, NOT WHAT YOU THINK YOU CAN DO. this section does not need to be that complciated, however it does need to look and feel good and modern and interactive

7) Make like the text that is diaplayed on the hero like something cool and unqiue. Also have like a subtitle or some thing. Thus should have a cool aniamtio nas well. DO not say STEM Council or Earl of March as the title for the hero, but you coud reference htem in a subtitle or pargrpah if necesary
